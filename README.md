# Financial Market Price Prediction Using Transformer Models

## Project Overview
This project applies AI techniques to predict gold price movements (XAUUSD) using over 51,000 hourly data points (2016–2024). We developed and compared three models—LSTM, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and an Attention-based model—for market trend forecasting and trading strategy optimization.

## Key Highlights
- **Dataset**: Hourly price data with ATR (Average True Range) for volatility assessment.
- **Best Model**: TCN achieved a 55% win rate and 451% ROI, outperforming LSTM and Attention models.
- **Comparison**: TCN surpassed traditional methods (ARIMA, GARCH) in scalability and profitability.
